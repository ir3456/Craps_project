# Craps_project
I created and developed a Craps simulator with which I used Monte Carlo methods
to sample large amounts of data. I then performed statistical analysis on this
data.

A basic, succinct summary of these results can be found at
http://isaacrobbins.com/projects/. The 'Craps Notebook.ipynb' is more in depth
and also interactive, importing the actual code from 'Craps.py'.

Enjoy!!
